// Define the top-level class of enumerated KTAB models.
//
// Examples of explicitly enumerated policy-spaces include the following.
// 1-dim SMP, {0/100, 1/100, ..., 99/100, 100/100}, with 101 positions.
// 2-dim SMP, with 10K positions.
// Set of sequential agendas over N items, with (N!)/2 positions
// Set of actors to be included (or not) in a committee, with 2-dim SMP to follow.
// and many more.
//
// Initially, the reformpri and comsel actually have enumerated spaces,
// so the things which appear in both are clear candidates to get raised up
// into EModel, EState, etc.
//
// Some issue spaces are too large to enumerate, so they must be treated as "implicit".
// They include the following.
// Revenue-neutral tax/subsidy policy over 20 items
// 3-, 4- or 5-dim SMP.
//
// Obviously, the SMP can be done as enumerated or implicit, and they
// must agree (within round-off error) for 1- and 2-dim.
// The only way to ensure that is with code-sharing.
